# About this script
# ================

# Loads ED bed move data generated by get-ED-data-from-Star.R
# Creates an edge list, which contains one row per bed move per patient
# and has a timestamp. 
#
# This patient level data is summarised into a grouped edge list 
# with weights, ready for network analysis. 
#
# In order to decide on the cut point for edge weights, 
# some plots are generated

# Load libraries
