# About this folder

This is a series of files to train models to predict admissions from ED. 

## Order to run files in

### 1. get-obs-lab-data-from-star.R

Output
- obs_raw 
- lab_raw

### 2. clean_obs_data.R

Takes observation data and removes any csns that are not included in ED_bed_moves. Includes some processing to map the csns in flowsheets to revised csns that were generated in the process of cleaning/creating ED_bed_movws. Uses foreign and primary keys on bed_moves to do this.

Cleans non-numeric fields to make them numeric (e.g. separates blood pressure into systolic and diastolic)

Names of flowsheet measurements are cleaned

Input
- obs_raw 
- summ (to get presentation and discharge from ED time)

Output
- obs_real - all data from selected flowsheet measurements in long matrix
- obs_to_include (needed for real-time prediction)

Note that this excludes any csns that did not have obs measurements


### 3. clean_lab_data.R

Takes lab data and removes any csns that are not included in ED_bed_moves. Includes some processing to map the csns in labs to revised csns that were generated in the process of cleaning/creating ED_bed_mvoes. Uses foreign and primary keys on bed_moves to do this.

Input
- lab_orders_raw 
- lab_results_raw
- summ

Output
- lab_orders_real
- lab_results_real
- lab_orders_to_include (needed for real-time prediction)

Note that all of these files exclude any csns that did not have lab measurements

### 4. generate_timeslices.R

Input
- lab_real
- obs_real
- moves
- summ

output- a series of design matrices for ML

### 5.  run-ML.R

Runs XGBoost

Inputs
- design matrices from generate-timeslices.R

Outputs
- scores for all tuning rounds
- saved learners for MLR
- save features used in each model (needed for real-time prediction)
- feature importances for each model

### 5a. Reporting on tuning

Prints charts showing outputs from tuning, including charts showing
- timeslice class balance

### 6. generate-prob-dist-and-pt-estimates.R

Taking the saved learners from the previous script, this generates a variety of probability distributions based on an input set of dates and times (typically the dates and times of reporting points of interest in the validation or test set). These distributions are aggregated from individual probabilities to make predictions about the number of patients to be admitted, either at any point, or within a specified time window. This can include

- just the patients in ED at each time point of interest
- also the patients who have not yet arrived at the time point, but who might arrive and be admitted within the time window; in this case it can either use a poisson mean derived from empirical data, or a poisson mean loaded from predictions made be a NGBoost model

In order to calculate admissions within time window, a binomial approach is used assuming independent probabilities of being admitted, and being admitted within a time window

Inputs
- design matrices from generate-timeslices.R
- saved learners for MLR
- poisson means (generated by file calc-not-yet-arrived.R or by other other method)
- time to admission (generated by calc-time-to-admission.R)

Outputs
- predicted probability of admission for all patients in ED at the time points of interest
- predicted aggregated number of admissions, plus actual number number of admissions at that time point

### 7. predict-and-plot-CORU-chart.R

Loads models and creates an aggregate distribution and evaluates it

### 8. evaluate-pt-estimates.R

Evaluates the distributions created by generate-prob-dist-and-pt-estimates.R

Inputs
- predicted aggregated number of admissions, plus actual number number of admissions at that time point from generate-prob-dist-and-pt-estimates.R

Outputs
- a saved file of metrics (rmse, mae and r squared for any distributions of interest)

### calc-not-yet-arrived.R

Creates an empirical distribution of mean number of patients who have not yet arrived, but will be admitted within a time window, varying by week/weekend, time of day (based on four time points of interest), pre/post/pre + post Covid, time window for arrival

- poisson-means-not-yet-arrived.R

This is used by generate-prob-dist-and-pt-estimates.R and also by the real-time predictions

### calc-time-to-admission.R

Creates an empirical distribution of number of hours to admission for all patients who are admitted, varying by timeslice, time of day (based on four time points of interest), pre/post/pre + post Covid, time window for arrival

### plot-ED-examples

Used to create plots of example ED patients for use in presentations only

### Other files 

- run-LR-using-stats
- run-RF

### Saved in the explore folder in case useful - not in current pipeline

- create-lab-test-clusters - no longer needed now that lab batteries are used instead
